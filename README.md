finally bruh i spent most of today just trying to get my github to sync up with my vscode. it was because my vscode was set to origin master but my github was origin main and honestly it took way too long to get vscode to switch. Anyways, today was mostly spent on planning what I want my honeypot to do, and then some very basic implementation of that. I think i will make a pretend server to just see if my code would run the way i want it to without adding any real server implementation. That is until I find out how to implement and use a real ssh server for this project.
